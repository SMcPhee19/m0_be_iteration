# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
- If I had to put a number on it, I would say that I am about at a 70% confidence level with the `each` method. I got bogged down when I was asked to do more complex commands inside of the steps. The print only the words that have three letters took me a decent chunk of time that was just trial and error to figure out.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
- It felt good to be challenged like that agian. I enjoyed that part about being in university. I did productive struggle there a lot. it was a lot of try this, see if it works, try someing else see if that worked. There was also a lot of googling and wathcing tutorials to try to see if I could find what I need. For the first time today, that being day 3, I found myself with the worst unproductive struggle of the week. I had to get up from my computer and walk away for a solid 15-20 minutes to clear my frustrations. I got up walked around, hung out with one of my dogs. 
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? 
- I still need some practice with all of it, and remembering that I can put other commands inside the larger commands.
- Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- I will probably need to adjust my calender to accomodate the need to review a little bit more.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- Still have some questions related to what commands you can run on the array to get the specific outcomes. I will work on some examples look over other people's answers in slack and watch some youtube videos.
